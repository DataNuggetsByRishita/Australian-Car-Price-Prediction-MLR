# Australian-Car-Price-Prediction-MLR
This project was developed to support the strategic expansion of an Australian car company into the U.S. used vehicle market. Using a dataset of 60,000+ car listings sourced from Craigslist, I conducted full-cycle data analysis including data cleaning, EDA (univariate, bivariate, and multivariate), and built a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model to predict car prices.

The objective was to uncover which features — such as condition, fuel type, mileage, and car age — most significantly affect pricing. The project includes not only technical model evaluation (R², MAE, RMSE, VIF) but also a business-focused interpretation, leading to actionable recommendations for pricing, inventory strategy, and market targeting.

A final business report is included to communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders such as marketing and sales managers..
