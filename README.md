# Australian-Car-Price-Prediction-MLR
Project Overview

This project was developed to support the strategic expansion of an Australian automotive company into the U.S. used vehicle market.

Using a dataset of over 60,000 car listings sourced from Craigslist, the project delivers an end-to-end data analysis and predictive modeling solution to identify key price drivers and support data-driven business decisions.

The primary objective was to determine which vehicle attributes most significantly influence pricing and to build a robust Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model for price prediction.

Business Objective

Identify the most impactful features affecting used car prices

Develop a predictive pricing model to support strategic decisions

Translate statistical findings into actionable business recommendations

Support pricing strategy, inventory planning, and market positioning

Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Removing inconsistencies and duplicates

Feature engineering (e.g., deriving car age from manufacturing year)

Encoding categorical variables

Outlier detection and treatment

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate analysis to understand individual variable distributions

Bivariate analysis to assess relationships between predictors and price

Multivariate analysis to examine interactions and correlations

3. Model Development – Multiple Linear Regression

Model training and validation

Assumption testing (linearity, normality, multicollinearity)

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis

Residual diagnostics

Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using:

R² (Coefficient of Determination)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)

These metrics ensured both statistical reliability and practical relevance for business decision-making.

Key Findings

The analysis identified the following as major price determinants:

Vehicle condition

Fuel type

Mileage

Vehicle age

Select model-specific characteristics

These insights provide a strong foundation for optimizing pricing strategy and improving inventory decisions.

Business Impact

Beyond technical modeling, the project translates quantitative findings into strategic insights for non-technical stakeholders such as marketing, sales, and expansion teams.

The final deliverable includes a comprehensive business report outlining:

Pricing optimization strategies

Inventory mix recommendations

Market segmentation insights

Competitive positioning guidance
